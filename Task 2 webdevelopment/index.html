                <h4>What is Artificial intelligence:-</h4><br>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by animals and humans. 
                    <br>Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, as well as other mappings of inputs. 
                    <br>The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press defines artificial intelligence as:the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally 
                    <br>require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. </p>
                    Artificial Intelligence can be further classified based on its complexity to replicate human intelligence.<br> These characteristics refer to their real-world usage, along with the technology involved. This breaks down AI into real and hypothetical systems. The Different types of AI are as follows:
